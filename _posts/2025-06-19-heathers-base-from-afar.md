My wife's beautiful base has two main buildings: Player House and Villager House.  Here's what I see standing in front of my own base:

I love the slopes of the roofs, so smooth!  She does such a great job with the color palettes and details.  Amazing what sorts of details she can add to really spruce up the place.  What I love most is Roy is copying her and even adding his own texture in walls now!!!  Incredible to see him grow; has a great teacher, that's for sure!

I'll give a more detailed run through of everything, just wanted to test out images on my blog.  Seems to be working so far, so exciting!!
