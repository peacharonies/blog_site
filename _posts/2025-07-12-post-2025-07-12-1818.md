# Illinois Notary Public Commission

Earned an Illinois Commission for a Notary Public!  

Two weeks into my new Tax and Accounting Clerk job, the CFO asked me unexpectedly if I wanted to become a Notary.  Said yes on Monday, and earned my commission by Thursday.  Talk about fast turnaround!  Had to take a required three hour course on being a Notary Public which wasn't too bad, the company paid for it even!  Aced the test, so went well.

As a kid, I was always in awe at the official seals and stamps on documents, commanding authority.  Although Illinois no longer embosses (shucks...), my stamp looks awesome with its state seal!  Look forward to helping out with the new powers bestowed upon me.
